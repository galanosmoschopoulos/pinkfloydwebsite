# Pink Floyd tribute website

This website contains information on the rock band "Pink Floyd" (eg. information regarding their albums, the members, pictures of concerts, their history, etc.).

### Why I created it

During a summer course on web design I enrolled in, we were asked to chose a topic of our choice and create a website regarding the said topic. I chose to present my favourite rock band, Pink Floyd. The first version of the website was a plain white page with a few paragraphs on it. As I learned more stuff regarding HTML, CSS and JS, I updated the website in order to implemented all the new techniques I'd been taught.

### How to see it

Clone the repository and open the file ```index.html``` with a browser of your choice (please don't use Internet Explorer).

### Tools used

- Google Chrome: website renderer and debuger
