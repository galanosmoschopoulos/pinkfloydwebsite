						<h2 class="albumTitle">1988: Delicate Sound of Thunder</h2>
						<article class="albumParagraph">
							<p>Delicate Sound of Thunder is the first entirely live album by English progressive rock band Pink Floyd. It was recorded over five nights at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, New York, in August 1988 and mixed at Abbey Road Studios in September 1988. It was released on 22 November 1988, through EMI Records in the United Kingdom and Columbia Records in the United States.</p>
                            <p>The album was released in 1988 as a double LP, double cassette, and a double CD, each format containing a slightly different track listing. The album includes many works from A Momentary Lapse of Reason as well as tracks from older Pink Floyd albums. The double LP release did not have "Us and Them" on the track listing. Both the double LP and the double cassette had "Wish You Were Here" between "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)" and "Comfortably Numb".</p>
                            <p>Although David Gilmour stated around the time of its release and on a radio interview in 1992 that the album contained no studio overdubbing whatsoever, he embellished the tracks during mixing with some extra acoustic guitar on "Comfortably Numb", according to engineer Buford Jones. In addition, some harmonies were replaced by studio re-takes: Richard Wright re-did his vocal on "Time" and Sam Brown replaced Rachel Fury's part in "Comfortably Numb"[5] but the rest of the album is as performed at the shows.</p>                            <p>An expanded version of the live album was included in The Later Years 1987–2019 box set in 2019, including performances omitted from the original release due to the limitations of vinyl records. Previously unreleased tracks include "Signs of Life," "One Slip," "A New Machine (Part 1)", "Terminal Frost", "A New Machine (Part 2)", and "Welcome to the Machine". This reissue marks the first official release of Pink Floyd playing a live version of "Welcome to the Machine." All tracks were remixed for the 2019 reissue.</p>

						<article class="albumParagraph">
                            <p>Pulse (stylised as p·u·l·s·e) is a live album by the English rock band Pink Floyd.

It was released on 29 May 1995 by EMI in the United Kingdom and on 6 June 1995 by Columbia in the United States.[3] The album was recorded during the European leg of Pink Floyd's Division Bell Tour in 1994.</p>
                            <p>The album is notable for including a complete live version of The Dark Side of the Moon. It also features "Astronomy Domine", a Syd Barrett song not performed since the early 1970s. The track "Another Brick in the Wall, Part II" features small portions of the songs "Another Brick in the Wall, Part I", "The Happiest Days of Our Lives" and "Another Brick in the Wall, Part III". "Take It Back" was originally going to be on the album with the recording from 25 September 1994, Stade Olympique de la Pontaise, Lausanne but was cut due to length.</p>
                            <p>Unlike the previous live album Delicate Sound of Thunder, no parts of the songs were re-recorded in the studio.[4] However, the band and Guthrie fixed songs that had bad notes (as heard on some bootlegs) by lifting solos and corrected vocal lines from other performances as the band recorded most of the European leg. The album was mixed in QSound, which produces a 3D audio effect even on a two channel stereo system.</p>
